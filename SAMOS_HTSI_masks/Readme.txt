The target is NGC3918; point center of telescope to:
11h50m17.77095049s -57d10m57.01730243s
 (177.57404563, -57.18250481)

We are using a 63-element S-matrix, so 63 exposures (sorry).

Exposure is 3 sec/mask frame.
Would love to collect the same mask set for a calibration lamp, but can't even guess the exposure time
Would love at least one slit camera image from the sequence just to see how well we guessed slit placement

I don't know the value of "ON" for the DMD.  There are two sets of numbered bitmap files provided; select the one that is correct.
Folder NGC3918_S63_ON001 - the two DMD values are (0,1)
Folder NGC3918_S63_ON255 - the two DMD values are (0,255)

The masks sets cycle through the S-matrices, and also have three fixed MOS slits that monitor two stars and one sky region.
